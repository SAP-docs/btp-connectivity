# Connectivity in the Kyma Environment

Find an overview of Connectivity components you can use for different purposes in the Kyma environment.

Connectivity features are available for native consumption by workloads within the Kyma environment. Destinations and related resources are managed centrally and technical connectivity is facilitated with the help of Transparent Proxy and Connectivity Proxy which are both offered as Kyma modules. This approach simplifies lifecycle management operations based on the *Kubernetes Operator* pattern.

> ### Note:  
> The feature set of Transparent Proxy and Connectivity Proxy provided as Kyma modules may differ from their general offering as Kuberenetes-based deployments, which are fully operated by you.

## Destination Service

Use the Destination service to centrally manage destinations and related resources, and delegate actions like access token retrieval and X.509 client certificate renewal.

## Transparent Proxy

Use the Transparent Proxy to achieve unified, virtually transparent technical connectivity to any remote target application, service or system, hosted in the cloud, on premises or in a VPC \(virtual private cloud\) environment on hyperscalers.

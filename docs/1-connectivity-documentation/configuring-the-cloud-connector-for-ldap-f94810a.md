**Scenario 1**: Cloud applications using LDAP for authentication. Configure the destination of the LDAP server in the Cloud Connector: [Configure Access Control \(LDAP\)](configure-access-control-ldap-e4ba9b3.md).

**Scenario 2**: Internal Cloud Connector user management. Activate LDAP user management in the Cloud Connector: [Use LDAP for User Administration](use-ldap-for-user-administration-120ceec.md).

# Destination Service

Learn how to manage destinations and consume the Destination service in SAP BTP, Multi-Cloud Foundation.

> ### Note:  
> The on-premise use cases described in this guide are also applicable to virtual private cloud \(VPC\) environments.

The Destination service lets you find the information that is required to access a remote service or system from your cloud application.

-   For the connection to an on-premise system, you can use this service together with the Connectivity service.
    -   For Kubernetes environments, use the Destination service, the Connectivity Proxy and the Transparent Proxy for connections to the target system.

-   For the connection to any other Web application, you can use the Destination service without the Connectivity service.
    -   For Kubernetes environments, use the Destination service and the Transparent Proxy for automated and seamless connections to the target system.

-   Manages routing and authentication details, as well as custom scenario-specific parameters.
-   Performs authentication flows based on the configured details.

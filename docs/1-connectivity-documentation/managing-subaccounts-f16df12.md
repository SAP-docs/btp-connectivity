# Managing Subaccounts

Add and connect your SAP BTP subaccounts to the Cloud Connector.

> ### Note:  
> This topic refers to subaccount management in the Cloud Connector. If you are looking for information about managing subaccounts on SAP BTP \(Cloud Foundry or Neo environment\), see

## Context

You can connect to several subaccounts within a single Cloud Connector installation. Those subaccounts can use the Cloud Connector concurrently with different configurations. By selecting a subaccount from the drop-down box, all tab entries show the configuration, audit, and state, specific to this subaccount. In case of audit and traces, cross-subaccount info is merged with the subaccount-specific parts of the UI.

> ### Note:  
> We recommend that you group only subaccounts with the same qualities in a single installation:
> 
> -   Productive subaccounts should reside on a Cloud Connector that is used for productive subaccounts only.
> -   Test and development subaccounts can be merged, depending on the group of users that are supposed to deal with those subaccounts. However, the preferred logical setup is to have separate development and test installations.

## Prerequisites

You have assigned one of these roles/role collections to the subaccount user that you use for initial Cloud Connector setup, depending on the SAP BTP environment in which your subaccount is running:

> ### Note:  
> For the **Cloud Foundry** environment, you must know on which cloud management tools feature set \(A or B\) your account is running. For more information on feature sets, see [Cloud Management Tools â€” Feature Set Overview](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/caf4e4e23aef4666ad8f125af393dfb2.html "Cloud management tools represent the group of technologies designed for managing SAP BTP.") :arrow_upper_right:.

After establishing the Cloud Connector connection, this user is not needed any more, since it serves only for initial connection setup. You may revoke the corresponding role assignment then and remove the user from the *Members* list.

> ### Note:  
> If the Cloud Connector is installed in an environment that is operated by SAP, SAP provides a user that you can add as member in your SAP BTP subaccount and assign the required role.



## Subaccount Dashboard

In the subaccount dashboard \(choose your *Subaccount* from the main menu\), you can check the state of all subaccount connections managed by this Cloud Connector at a glance.

![Subaccount Dashboard](images/SCC_ManagingSubaccounts_-_Dashboard_d7625b2.png)

In the screenshot above, the subaccount with display name *trial* \(actual subaccount ID starts with *ab1220dc-5bfb-45d1-9...*\) is already connected, but has no active resources exposed. All other subaccounts are connected with exposed resources and are fully operational. In addition, depending on the connection state, the dashboard allows you to do disconnect and connect subaccounts by pressing the respective button in the *Actions* column. You may also view details of, delete, or navigate to a subaccount using buttons from the *Actions* column.

The *Sort* buttons for the columns **Subaccount** and **Display Name** let you sort the entries by the column either ascending or descending, and the *Filter* buttons in the colunms let you filter the listed entries.

You can use the *Filter* buttons above the dashboard to filter the shown subaccounts based on the connection status. You can select *all subaccounts*, *all connected ones*, *all disconnected ones*, *all subaccounts currently in connecting or reconnecting status*, or *all subaccounts for which establishing the connection has failed*.

If you want to connect an additional subaccount with your on-premise landscape, simply press the *Add Subaccount* button, which opens a dialog that is similar to the [Initial Configuration](initial-configuration-db9170a.md) operation when establishing the first connection.

## Procedure

1.  The *<Region\>* field specifies the SAP BTP region that should be used, for example, `Europe (Rot)`. Choose the one you need from the drop-down list.

    > ### Remember:  
    > The available regions and region domains depend on the SAP BTP environment you are using. For more information, see [Regions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/3504ec5ef16548778610c7e89cc0eac3/Cloud/en-US/350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html) \(Cloud Foundry and ABAP environment\) or [Regions and Hosts Available for the Neo Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/d722f7cea9ec408b85db4c3dcba07b52.html).

    > ### Tip:  
    > You can also configure a region yourself, if it is not part of the standard list. Either insert the region host manually, or create a custom region, as described in [Configure Custom Regions](configure-custom-regions-a994a75.md).

2.  For *<Subaccount\>* and *<Subaccount User\>* \(user/password\), enter the values you obtained when you registered your account on SAP BTP.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your subaccount is on **Cloud Foundry**, you must enter the subaccount **ID** as *<Subaccount\>*, rather than its actual \(technical\) name. For information on getting the subaccount ID, see [Find Your Subaccount ID \(Cloud Foundry Environment\)](find-your-subaccount-id-cloud-foundry-environment-b43eff2.md). As *<Subaccount User\>* you must provide your `Login E-mail` instead of a user ID.
    > 
    > For the **Neo** environment, enter the subaccount's **technical name** in the field *<Subaccount\>*, not the subaccount ID.

    Alternatively, you can add a new subaccount user in the SAP BTP cockpit, assign the required authorization \(see section **Prerequisites** above\), and use the new user and password.

    > ### Note:  
    > The Cloud Connector does not yet support *SAP Universal ID*. Please use your S-user or P-user credentials for the *<subaccount user\>* and *<password\>* fields instead.
    > 
    > For more information, see SAP note [3085908](https://me.sap.com/notes/3085908).

    > ### Tip:  
    > When using SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication \(IAS\) as platform identity provider with two-factor authentication \(2FA / MFA\) for your subaccount, you can simply append the required token to the regular password. For example, if your password is "eX7?6rUm" and the one-time passcode is "123456", you must enter "eX7?6rUm123456" into the *<Password\>* field.

    > ### Tip:  
    > For a subaccount in the **Cloud Foundry** environment, the Cloud Connector supports the use of a custom identity provider \(IDP\) via single sign-on \(SSO\) passcode. For more information, see [Use a Custom IDP for Subaccount Configuration](use-a-custom-idp-for-subaccount-configuration-2022612.md).

3.  \(Optional\) You can define a *<Display Name\>* that allows you to easily recognize a specific subaccount in the UI compared to the technical subaccount name.
4.  \(Optional\) You can define a *<Location ID\>* that identifies the location of this Cloud Connector for a specific subaccount. As of Cloud Connector release 2.9.0, the location ID is used as routing information and therefore you can connect multiple Cloud Connectors to a single subaccount. If you don't specify any value for *<Location ID\>*, the default is used, which represents the behavior of previous Cloud Connector versions. The location ID must be unique per subaccount and should be an identifier that can be used in a URI. To route requests to a Cloud Connector with a location ID, the location ID must be configured in the respective destinations.
5.  \(Optional\) You can provide a *<Description\>* of the subaccount that is shown when clicking on the *Details* icon in the *Actions* column.
6.  Choose *Save*.



## Next Steps

-   To modify an existing subaccount, choose the *Edit* icon and change the *<Display Name\>*, *<Location ID\>* and/or *<Description\>*.

    ![](images/SCC_ManagingSubaccounts_-_EditAccount_cee3063.png)

-   You can also delete a subaccount from the list of connections.The subaccount will be disconnected and all configurations will be removed from the installation.

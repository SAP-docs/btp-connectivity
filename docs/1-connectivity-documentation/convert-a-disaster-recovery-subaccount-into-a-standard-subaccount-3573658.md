# Convert a Disaster Recovery Subaccount into a Standard Subaccount

Convert a disaster recovery sucaccount into a standard subaccount if the former primary subaccount's region cannot be recovered.

> ### Caution:  
> This feature is deprecated.
> 
> Due to the discontinuation of the *Enhanced Disaster Recovery Service*, the related functionality in the Cloud Connector has been dropped as of version 2.16.

Disaster recovery subaccounts that were switched to disaster recovery mode can be elevated to standard subaccounts if a disaster recovery region replaces an original region that is not expected to recover.

If a disaster recovery subaccount should be used as primary subaccount, you can convert it by choosing the button *Discard original subaccount and replace it with disaster recovery subaccount*.

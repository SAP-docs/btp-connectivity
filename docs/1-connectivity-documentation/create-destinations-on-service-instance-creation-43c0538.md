# Create Destinations on Service Instance Creation

Use a JSON to create or update a destination when creating a Destination service instance.

When creating or updating a service instance of the Destination service, you can provide a JSON object with various configurations. One of the sections of this JSON lets you create or update destinations. Other operations, like deleting a destination, are not supported by this method.

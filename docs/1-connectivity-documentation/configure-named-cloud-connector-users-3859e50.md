# Configure Named Cloud Connector Users

Set up LDAP-based user management for the Cloud Connector.

## LDAP-Based User Management

We recommend that you configure LDAP-based user management for the Cloud Connector to allow only named administrator users to log on to the administration UI.

This guarantees traceability of the Cloud Connector configuration changes via the Cloud Connector audit log. If you use the default and built-in `Administrator` user, you cannot identify the actual person or persons who perform configuration changes. Also, you will not be able to use different types of user groups.

## Configuration

If you have an LDAP server in your landscape, you can configure the Cloud Connector to authenticate Cloud Connector users against the LDAP server.

Valid users or user groups must be assigned to one of the following roles:

-   Administrator users: `admin` or `sccadmin`
-   Display users: `sccdisplay` or `sccmonitoring`

    > ### Note:  
    > The role `sccmonitoring` provides access to the monitoring APIs, and is particularly used by the SAP Solution Manager infrastructure, see [Monitoring APIs](monitoring-apis-f6e7a7b.md).

-   Support users: `sccsupport`

Alternatively, you can define custom role names for each of these user groups, see: [Use LDAP for User Administration](use-ldap-for-user-administration-120ceec.md).

Once configured, the default Cloud Connector `Administrator` user becomes inactive and can no longer be used to log on to the Cloud Connector.

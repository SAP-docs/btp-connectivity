Infrastructure and network facilities of the SAP BTP ensure security on network layer by limiting access to authorized persons and specific business purposes.

## Isolated Network

The SAP BTP landscape runs in an isolated network, which is protected from the outside by firewalls, DMZ, and communication proxies for all inbound and outbound communications to and from the network.

## Sandboxed Environments

The SAP BTP infrastructure layer also ensures that platform services, like the SAP BTP Connectivity, and applications are running isolated, in sandboxed environments. An interaction between them is only possible over a secure remote communication channel.

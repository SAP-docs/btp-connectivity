# Access the Destinations Editor

Access the Destinations Editor in the SAP BTP cockpit to create and manage destinations.

You can edit destinations at two different levels:

-   Subaccount level

-   Service instance level

On subaccount level, you can specify a destination for the entire subaccount, defining the used communication protocol and more properties, like authentication method, proxy type and URL.

On service instance level, you can reuse this destination for a specific space and adjust the URL if required. You can also create a new destination only on service instance level that is specific to the selected service instance and its assigned applications.

## Context

The Cloud Connector:

-   Serves as a link between SAP BTP applications and on-premises systems.
    -   Combines an easy setup with a clear configuration of the systems that are exposed to the SAP BTP.
    -   Lets you use existing on-premises assets without exposing the entire internal landscape.


-   Runs as on-premises agent in a secured network.
    -   Acts as a reverse invoke proxy between the on-premises network and SAP BTP.


-   Provides fine-grained control over:
    -   On-premises systems and resources that can be accessed by cloud applications.
    -   Cloud applications using the Cloud Connector.


-   Lets you use the features that are required for business-critical enterprise scenarios.
    -   Recovers broken connections automatically.
    -   Provides audit logging of inbound traffic and configuration changes.
    -   Can be run in a high-availability setup.

## Advantages

Compared to the approach of opening ports in the firewall and using reverse proxies in the DMZ to establish access to on-premises systems, the Cloud Connector offers the following benefits:

-   You don't need to configure the on-premises firewall to allow external access from SAP BTP to internal systems. For allowed outbound connections, no modifications are required.
-   The Cloud Connector supports HTTP as well as additional protocols. For example, the RFC protocol supports native access to ABAP systems by invoking function modules.
-   You can use the Cloud Connector to connect on-premises databases or BI tools to SAP HANA databases in the cloud.
-   The Cloud Connector lets you propagate the identity of cloud users to on-premises systems in a secure way.
-   Easy installation and configuration, which means that the Cloud Connector comes with a low TCO and is tailored to fit your cloud scenarios.
-   SAP provides standard support for the Cloud Connector.

## Extended Scenarios

Besides the standard setup: *SAP BTP - Cloud Connector - on-premises system/network*, you can also use the Cloud Connector to connect SAP BTP applications to other cloud-based environments, as long as they are operated in a way that is comparable to an on-premises network from a functional perspective. This is particularly true for infrastructure \(IaaS\) hosting solutions.

Here's an overview of all environments in which you can or cannot set up the Cloud Connector:

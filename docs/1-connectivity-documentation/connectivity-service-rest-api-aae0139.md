# Connectivity Service REST API

Use a REST API to read information about Cloud Connectors connected to a given SAP BTP subaccount.

The Connectivity service provides a REST API that lets you read information about Cloud Connectors connected to a given subaccount. This API is documented in the [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_CF_Connectivity/overview). It shows all available endpoints, the supported operations, parameters, possible error cases, related status codes, and so on.

You can also try it out via executing requests using the credentials of your [Connectivity Service instance](create-and-bind-a-connectivity-service-instance-a2b88cf.md).

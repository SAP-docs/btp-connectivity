How to edit and delete destinations in the *Destinations* editor \(SAP BTP cockpit\).



## Prerequisites

You have previously created or imported an HTTP destination in the *Destinations* editor of the cockpit.



## Procedure

-   Edit a destination:
    1.  To edit a created or imported destination, choose the ![](images/Edit_destination_cockpit_5099ac0.png) button.
    2.  You can edit the main parameters as well as the additional properties of a destination.
    3.  Choose the *Save* button. The changes will take effect in up to five minutes.

        > ### Tip:  
        > For complete consistency, we recommend that you first stop your application, then apply your destination changes, and then start again the application. Also, bear in mind that these steps will cause application downtime.

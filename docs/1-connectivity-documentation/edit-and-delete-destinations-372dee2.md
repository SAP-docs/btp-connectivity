    3.  You can edit the main parameters as well as the additional properties of a destination.
    4.  When you are done, choose *Save*. The changes will take effect in up to five minutes.

        > ### Tip:  
        > For complete consistency, we recommend that you first stop your application, then apply your destination changes, and then start again the application. Also, bear in mind that these steps will cause an application downtime.


-   Delete a destination:

    To remove an existing destination, choose *Delete* in the detail view. The changes will take effect in up to five minutes.

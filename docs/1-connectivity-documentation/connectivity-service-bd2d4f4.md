# Connectivity Service

Learn how to manage and consume the Connectivity service in SAP BTP, Multi-Cloud Foundation.

> ### Note:  
> The on-premise use cases described in this guide are also applicable to virtual private cloud \(VPC\) environments.

The Connectivity service offers a set of services and software components which allow SAP BTP applications to securely access remote services that run on premises. It:

-   Allows you to make connections to on-premise systems.
-   Provides, together with the Cloud Connector, a secure tunnel from your on-premise network to applications on SAP BTP, while you keep full control and auditability of what is exposed to the cloud. This way, no network ports need to be exposed on the on-premise side.
-   Supports various communication protocols towards the target system.

# Destinations Pointing to Service Instances

Create a destination for subscription-based scenarios that points to your service instance.

> ### Note:  
> This feature is applicable for a selected set of the most commonly used services \(from a Destination service perspective\). If you would like to use this feature for a service which is not yet supported, let us know by opening a support ticket, see [Connectivity Support](connectivity-support-e5580c5.md).
> 
> In the meantime, you can follow the steps described in [Create Destinations from Scratch](create-destinations-from-scratch-5eba623.md).

Usually, in the Cloud Foundry environment, you consume service instances by binding them to your applications. However, in subscription-based scenarios this is not always possible. If you have purchased a subscription to an SaaS application that runs in a provider's subaccount, you cannot bind your service instance to this application.

In this case, you must create a destination that points to your service instance. Applications can consume this destination through a subscription to gain access to your service instance.

If you create such a destination from scratch, you must provide a service key for your instance, look up the credentials, and enter these values in the newly created destination.

Using the *Destinations Pointing to Service Instances* template, you only have to select the corresponding service instance.

> ### Note:  
> This procedure only applies for HTTP destinations on subaccount level.

## Prerequisites

-   You have a service instance which you want to make accessible to applications you are subscribed to.

-   You have the Space Developer role in the space where this service instance resides.

-   You have logged in to the cockpit and opened the *Destinations* editor on *subaccount* level. See [Access the Destinations Editor](access-the-destinations-editor-82ca377.md).




## Procedure

1.  Choose *New Destination*.
2.  Select the tab *Service Instance* in the **Destination Configuration** section.
3.  In the *<Service Instance\>* dropdown list, you find all the service instances, grouped by space, where you have the role Space Developer.
4.  Select a service instance.
5.  Give the destination configuration a name and, optionally, a description.
6.  \(Optional\) You can specify additional properties.
7.  Choose *Next*.

    A service key for that service instance is automatically generated, using the naming convention *<service\_instance\_name\>-service-key*. If the key name already exists, it is reused. A new destination with pre-filled fields is previewed, using the given service instance data. Do not change the values of these fields.

    8. If you want to create a destination with these values, choose *Save*. Otherwise, choose *Cancel*.

## Result

You have a destination pointing to your service instance. If you delete this service instance or its service key, the destination stops working.

> ### Caution:  
> If you delete this service instance or its service key, the destination will stop working.

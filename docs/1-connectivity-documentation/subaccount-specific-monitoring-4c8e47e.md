# Subaccount-Specific Monitoring

Use different monitoring views in the Cloud Connector administration UI to check subaccount-specific activites and data.

The Cloud Connector provides various views for monitoring the activities associated with an account, such as HTTP requests and RFC calls \(from cloud applications to backends as per access control settings\) or data statistics for service channels. Choose one of the sub-menus *Monitor \(Cloud to On-Premise\)* or *Monitor \(On-Premise to Cloud\)*.

> ### Caution:  
> The collected monitoring data is not part of the Cloud Connector's backup. After restoring a Cloud Connector instance, all monitoring collections are empty.
